MissingOutputException in rule make_plots in file "/Users/bushralat/Desktop/IS477 Workflow/Snakefile", line 57:
Job 5  completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
figures/distributions.png (missing locally, parent dir contents: corr_heatmap.png, rat_sightings_per_zip.png, avg_score_by_zip.png, rat_vs_critical.png, rat_vs_avg_score.png)
Removing output files of failed job make_plots since they might be corrupted:
figures/rat_sightings_per_zip.png, figures/avg_score_by_zip.png, figures/rat_vs_critical.png, figures/corr_heatmap.png, figures/rat_vs_avg_score.png
Shutting down, this might take some time.
